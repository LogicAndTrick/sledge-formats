//    various notes on DoD and CS fgds, as well as my own.
//  - Removed renderfield string codes and replaced them with "Renderfields"
//    baseclasses for cycler_wreckage, 
//  - env_fog upgraded to the choices/abilities other mods use, in case CS upgrades to full fog someday.
//  - added property of "shade"(_diffuse_light) to light enviornment for adam foster's hack of HLRAD, so that
//    shadows can be given a specific color.
//  - added skins for "water" (-3), "slime" (-4), "lava" (-5) and "make ladder" (-16) to func_illusionary
//  - added spawnflags "only trigger" (1) and "pressure" (4) to func_pushable as other ways to break it.
//  - gave func_train ALL the same skins as func_illusionary & func_water, even though the skins work oddly for a train.
//  - added skins "empty" (-1) and "ladder" (-16) to func_water.  note "ladder" only works with non ! textures.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// April 7th, 2002 - fjl (0.7.8)
//   - Global baseclass is a single player map option. The following baseclasses and
//     entities listed could support it so I added it to them.
//     BASECLASSES: Breakable, door, Basetank and Trackchange
//     SOLID ENTITIES func_button, func_conveyor, func_pendulum, func_plat,
//     func_rot_button, func_rotating, func_tracktrain, func_train and func_wall
//   - Added Master(string) to Basetank baseclass.
//   - Removed renderfield string codes and replaced them with "Renderfields"
//     baseclasses for cycle, cycler_sprite & button_target.
//   - Added the Appearflags("Not in Deathmatch") option to these listed entities and
//     baseclasses that where missing that parameter.
//     BASECLASSES: playerclass, door
//     ENTITIES: func_friction, func_pendulum, func_wall, infodecal
//   - Gave func_breakable the ability to spawn a battery, healthkit or shotgun
//     shells upon breaking. This options works a bit buggy since the spawned items
//     will continue to respawn on its own after its been picked up. If the
//     func_breakable is given a name, it will have the same effect as a
//     MonsterMaker by spawning the object each time its triggered.
//     Use this option wisely or only for single player maps.
//   - Added missing ZHLT options to func_friction.
//   - Added the "Instant Crowbar" flag to func_pushable. Not that this option is
//     usable for this mod, but I added it so whoever does the next Half-Life FGD
//     update, realizes that it supports that option.
//   - Added missing Renderfields baseclass to func_rot_button.
//   - Changed func_rotate to default to a speed of 50 instead of 0.
//   - Added item_healthkit to game_player_equip.
//   - Added ammo for the M249 Para on game_player_equip. Thanks to [B.o.G]doom for
//     this information.
//   - Added some extra information to the game_player_equip entity.
//   - Added character limit number for the "game_text" entity on its message string.
//   - Added "Renderfields" baseclass to hostage_entity. This allows the option for
//     hostages to be transparent, distorted, flickering or any of those other effects.
//   - Added "Renderfields" baseclass to item_healthkit, item_longjump and item_battery.
//   - Fixed light_spot bug where its default color was yellow instead of white.
//   - Gave Light_Environment the "Initially Dark" flag.
//   - Added "Appearance" effects to light_environment. This allows light_environment
//     to have the strobe and flicker light effects just incase you want to give
//     players an epileptic seizure while they play your map :)
//     Appearance's effect will not work if light_environment is given a name.
//   - Added "Custom Appearance" to light_environment. This option does require the
//     entity to have a name for it to work.
//   - Added the "target" field to light_environment. Add the light_environment
//     entity, and in the target field, add the name of its target(another entity).
//     Light_environment will now emit light in that direction from all sky brushes.
//     This should save time from trying to figure out the annoying angles and pitches.
//   - Added monster_scientist entity. Works the same as hostage_entity except that
//     it uses the scientist model. The scientist type(luther, einstein, etc.) is
//     also selectable. While it is possible to change hostage_entity into the
//     scientist model, a specific scientist type is not selectable.
//     Only monster_scientist has that option, which is why I added it.
//   - Added the sprite color to the multisource and multi_manager entities so they
//     are the same as Half-Life's FGD.
//   - Added "Global State Master" to trigger_auto.
//   - Fixed bug on trigger_counter, where field options repeated themselves.
//     This same bug seems to be plaguing all the other FGD's. Whoever plans to
//     updates those other FGD files should take note of it.
//   - Added "Level Fade In" and "CD track to play" to WorldSpawn. These options
//     should only be used for single player maps.
//   - Changed the baseclass name, zhltlightflags to ZHLT.
//   - Rearranged some of the entities code so that the most common fields and
//     options come before the other options. It was annoying having to scroll to
//     the bottom just to find out what some of them trigger or what their names are.
//     The Name of the entity should always come first and the other important
//     options right after. Something in the fashion listed below, that is, if they
//     contain those fields.
//     ------------------------
//     Name
//     Global Entity Name
//     Master
//     Target
//     Trigger delay
//     Pitch Yaw Roll (Y Z X)
//     Render FX
//     Render Mode
//     FX Amount(1 - 255)
//     FX Color (R G B)
//     Light Flags (ZHLT 2.2+)
//     Light Origin (ZHLT 2.2+)
//     ------------------------
//     Not all of them are exactly in this order since that would require re-writing
//     the whole FGD file, but I did manage to rearrange them to some extent for the
//     following baseclasses and entities listed below.
//     BASECLASSES: breakable, gibshooterbase and trigger
//     ENTITIES: env_sprite, func_button, func_door_rotating, func_pendulum,
//     func_platrot, func_rot_button, func_rotating, func_tracktrain, func_vehicle,
//     game_counter, game_counter_set, game_player_hurt, game_player_team,
//     info_teleport_destination, light, momentary_rot_button, path_track,
//     trigger_camera, trigger_changetarget, trigger_counter, trigger_hurt
//     and xen entities
//   - In order to help with the rearranging of the fields(read previous sentence), I
//     had to create a Master Baseclass. These are the following baseclasses and
//     entities that I removed the Master string from their code and replaced it with
//     the Master baseclass.
//     BASECLASSES: door and trigger 
//     ENTITIES: game_counter, game_counter_set, game_score, game_team_master,
//     game_text, game_zone_player, trigger_hurt, func_button, func_rot_button,
//     button_target and momentary_rot_button
//   - Added some extra information to Basetank baseclass and func_rot_button entity.
//   - Put line codes for trigger_gravity, func_wall, func_wall_toggle and func_water
//     entities in alphabetical order.
//   - Added some extra info to the previous update list and fixed some spelling errors.
//   - Updated once again, "cs_fgd_readme.txt" and "INSTALL.TxT"
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
// March 16th, 2002 - fjl (0.7.7)
//   - Added the "New Level Unit" Option on WorldSpawn.
//   - Added "weapon" baseclass.
//   - Added "Appearflags" baseclass.
//   - Added "Global" baseclass.
//   - Changed ZHLT _fade option to default to 1.0 instead of 0
//   - Changed ZHLT _falloff option to have a choice of "default," "linear," and "square."
//   - Removed the zhlt_lightflags choices from the "breakable" baseclass. It didn't need it.
//   - Added "Opaque + Concave Fix" to zhlt_lightflags.
//   - Changed IS NOT LOOPED to NOT TOGGLED on ambient_generic
//   - Removed ZHLT from func_wall_toggle. It caused ZHLT options to repeat.
//   - Added a Targetname and ZHLT _fade and _falloff options to light_environment.
//   - Changed light_environment so it defaults to an angle of 270 and pitch of -90.
//     Similar to high noon sunlight.
//   - Added the ZHLT _fade and _falloff options for light_spot.
//   - Changed all light entities to start with a white brightness(255 255 255 200)
//     instead of the annoying yellow color(255 255 128 200).
//   - Added "Angular Velocity" to func_train. Angle does not reset with a new round.
//     Hopefully VALVe will fix this in the future.
//   - Changed trigger_gravity to display "Gravity (0.0-1)" instead of "Gravity (0-1)"
//   - Added cycler entity.
//   - Added cycler_wreckage. Seems its just a big smoke sprite used for machine wrecks
//     so I edited it to not show the targetted sprite by default. If it does show the
//     sprite, it will simply look like a sprite stuck inside the smoke stack. It was
//     best to make it invisible. If a bigger sprite is used like say 320hud1.spr there
//     will be a more spread out smoke stack. Bigger sprite = wider smoke stack. 
//   - Added env_fade.
//   - Added env_fog in hopes to get VALVe to implement it for this mod and make it
//     compatible for software and direct3d modes. Currently doesn't work with
//     Counter-Strike version 1.3
//     LIMITATIONS:
//     Currently (as of Half-Life 1.1.0.8), objects outside of the 100% opacity range
//     are still drawn and still contribute to the overall polygon count. This entity is
//     still quite under development.
//     The fog is only drawn in OpenGL mode. This means users who are viewing the level
//     in Software or Direct3D rendering will not see the fog. For this reason, if you
//     plan on releasing your map publicly, the env_fog entity should not be used as it
//     will put OpenGL users at a disadvantage.
//   - Added func_guntarget.
//   - Added func_recharge and func_healthcharger. Currently the dmdelay,
//     "Deathmatch recharge delay" does not work with CS 1.3. Hopefully
//     this will be fixed in the future.
//   - Added func_tanklaser
//   - Removed func_tankrocket seeing as how CS cannot support the rocket entity.
//   - Added all missing weapons for game_player_equip plus added item_longjump &
//     item_battery including all weapon ammo. Almost did a complete re-write to this
//     entity to make it alot easier to use. I just can't figure out nightvision goggles
//     and ammo for the para. If you figure it out, please contact me. I would advice
//     using this item to give players the longjump or the battery wisely. Those items
//     do not magically dissapear like all the others. They will remain even after
//     a round ends. Also, You can't give all weapons and items at one time. SO DON'T TRY!
//   - Added gibshooter entity.
//   - Added item_longjump, item_battery and item_healthkit entities. These respawn
//     like in HL deathmatch. They might be a bit buggy though.
//   - Added xen entities.
//   - Rearranged the update list so the latest additions are on top.
//   - Updated the "readme.txt" that comes with the zip file and renamed it to
//     "cs_fgd_readme.txt" so it will not over write Worldcraft's "readme.txt" file.
//   - Created an "install.txt" for the zip file.
//   - Created a single player FGD file for anyone wanting to create training maps.
//     It contains the level transition entities required to make such maps. Plus it
//     contains many other entities that have some type of use on single player maps but
//     are not supported for multiplayer maps. The file is named "cs-single_player.fgd"
//     and it MUST be used alongside this FGD file. Read that FGD file to learn more.
//
// Jan 26, 2001 - Tim Holt (0.7.6)
//   - Added "No Clients" check option to Trigger base class per suggestion/lead
//     from Mataleone (cs mapping forum)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Jan 6, 2001 - Tim Holt (0.7.5)
//   - Added new parameter options for game_player_equip to list all
//     CS items in dialog, thus removing the need to turn off SmartEdit
//     to configure.
//   - Added new sprite for trigger_auto (green box with words "Trigger Auto")
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// 01/05/2001 - Morlam (0.7.4)
//   - Added _fade and _falloff keys to the light_ entities.  Need ZHLT 2.2+
//	 for these to work.
//   - Added light_origin key to the ZHLT Light Flags BaseClass.  Again, you
//	 need the latest version of Zoner's Tools for light_origin to work.
//   - Moved circus and extra from the "Class Info" tab to the "Flags" tab.
//   - Shortened the SmartEdit names of certain key/values in info_compile_params
//	 so that they aren't cut off (at least, on my 800X600 screen on a 15 inch 
//	 monitor).
//
// 01/04/2001 - Morlam (0.7.3)
//   - Arranged all the point entities in alphabetical order
//   - Corrected a typo in hostage_entity: "Orange Suit Worker" from
//	 "Orange Suite Worker".
//   - Changed func_water default WaveHeight to 0
//   - Added ZHLT Light Flags to func_plat, _pendulum and _vehicle
//   - Under info_compile_params:
//		- Changed extra to choices instead of a string; default is now 0
//		- Changed extra to read: "Enable Extra mode in HLRAD?"
//		- Added hullfile, chop, texchop, circus, and dscale keys
//		- Added "No Clip" flag under Run BSP in the spawnflags
//   - Under info_lights_rad:
//		- added radfile key/value, specifies custom texture light file
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// 01/01/2001 - Tim Holt (0.7.2)
//   - Added new dropdown to hostage entity, so you can choose hostage skin
//     directly by name (orange suit guy or tie guy)
//   - Removed commented out "master" option for game_zone_player.  It was
//     commented out from the original HL FGD for some reason.  Not sure why
//     or if maybe there is a problem with it?
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// 12/31/2000 - Tim Holt (0.7.1)
//   - Added new sprites for all the Game entities
//   - Added new sprite for Player Weapon Strip
//   - Added new sprite for Trigger_Relay
//   - Added new sprite for Trigger_ChangeTarget
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Original changes by Tim Holt (0.7.0)
//   - Added new Trigger Changetarget sprite (green cube w/words)
//   - Added new Info Target sprite (bullseye)
//   - Added new trigger_camera sprite (Video camera)
//   - Added new Multi Manager sprite (box w/arrows coming out of it)
//   - Added new "Cycler Sprite" sprite (box w/arrow circle around it)
//   - Added replacement ambient_generic sprite (changed from speaker to speaker
//     with words "Ambient Generic" around it")
//   - Added replacement env_sound sprite (changed from speaker to speaker
//     with words "Env Sound" around it")
//   - Added replacement light_spot sprite (changed from lightbulb to spotlight)
//   - Added replacement Light Environment sprite (changed from lightbulb to sun)
//   - Added all the "game_*" entities
//   - Added info_compile_params and info_lights_rad entities.  Idea is to
//     get someone like Zoner to implement support for them in Zoners, or
//     build support for them into a compile tool like Q2Beaver, HLCC, etc.
//   - Added env_funnel
//   - Added trigger_gravity
//   - Added player_weaponstrip
//   - Put Zoners RAD option (that allow solid (func_) based ents to cast
//     shadows) into a number of new additional items that can support it.
//     Use with caution, as for example a func_pushable can cast a shadow now,
//     but if you push it, the shadow stays behind :^)
//
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Note:  I have not fully tested the support of ALL the game_ entities in
// CS.  I DO know that some work thru experimentation.  Let me know if you
// find interesting things about these little known and used entities in CS.

		2: "Texture - some light"
